# This is a template useful to create guides

This a Sphinx based documentation. 
If you are unfamiliar with Sphinx, we recommend that you first read 
[Getting Started with Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html).

When creating a new repository, this template could be used.

The values in ``docs/conf.py`` should be replaced by the name of your project.
